# MetaCognitionEngine
Metacognition Engine project is a React-based implementation of the "Metacognition" decision frameworks demonstrated by Satya Nadella (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEZADIErqyw). It orchestrates multiple AI agents (The Visionary, The Skeptic, The Historian) to debate and synthesize improved decision-making.
